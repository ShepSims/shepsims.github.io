					<h2>Meta's OPT vs OpenAI GPT-3</h2>					
					<h5>
						What are Large Language Models, what are they used for, what are the existing solutions, and why Meta's new OPT matters
					</h5>
					<img class="image" src="./images/Robot thinking2.jpeg"/>
					<p>
						Yesterday Meta publicly released their 175 billion parameter Open Pre-Trained Transformer Language Model (OPT) and extensive
						associated documentation to compete with OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) API! 
						
						<p>If you're already deeply
						interested in Natural Language Processing, you're jumping out of your seat right now! If not, you are probably asking... What
						is NLP? What is different between GPT-3 and OPT? Will this open-sourcing cause a dramatic shift in LLM research?</p> 
						<br>
						<p>Hopefully, I
						can quickly answer a few of those! Keep in mind the future is built from the unknown and can only be learned as people begin
						to adopt this bleeding-edge technology... but let's dive in! </p> 
						<br>
						<p>To start off, what are LLMs, what can we use them for, and what
						has been backing up research up to this point? Large Language Models are massive AI models that are trained on vast written
						datasets that can be leveraged to complete various language processing tasks from sentiment detection on a phrase or paragraph
						to mimicking human conversation, generating complete scholarly articles around an input topic, and so much more! </p> 
						<p>Many of the
						use cases described in OPTs whitepaper revolve around bias and racism detection on text that might be used to prevent hate
						crimes or other nefarious social activity. What was GPT-3 and what's the difference between it and Meta's new OPT? Human
						speech inherently has many intricacies, and this can be reflected in a large number of parameters that must be trained for NLP
						models to be effective. </p>
						<br>
						<p>GPT-3 is OpenAI's solution, which trained 175 billion weighted parameters that help predict, classify,
						or otherwise make use of their dataset. The problem with GPT-3 is that it is only available for use as a paid service, and
						even then only through APIs, not through direct access to the model itself. This provides a significant barrier to entry for
						the average dev, and has kept the NLP community small. OPT completely changes the game in this regard! </p> 
						<br>
						<p>The Meta AI team sought
						to produce an equivalent model, also training on 175B parameters (and other, smaller numbers of parameters to make it cheaper
						and easier to work with for small teams). They have released not only the model itself, but all related documentation about
						how it was created and various code packages for easier onboarding. </p>
						<br>
						<p>This will hopefully drive NLP adoption and introduce new
						scientists to the community, help establish some best practices of NLP AI use, and further our understanding of how
						communication works. That said, there are some negative consequences that has become apparent as well and can be easily found
						with a few quick Googles. Meta has taken some measures to mitigate potential risks, but nothing in big tech can reduce that
						factor to 0. </p>

					<h2>Why go Serverless?</h2>
					<h5>
						Serverless architectures seem to be all the rage in the Cloud Computing world today, heres a brief discussion on why, and what
						they might offer you and your business.
					</h5>
					<img class="image" src="./images/drawing-38.jpg" />

					<p>
						<br />AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions square up against traditional server architectures in
						a battle to the death. (Just kidding, servers are still useful in some solutions)
					</p>

					<p>
						<br />Traditional application server architectures contain a central server that loiter around listening for incoming
						requests, processing them whenever they come in, and burning your money while they aren't. This server can be an on-premises
						or a remote hosted one, such as AWS EC2 instance, Google Compute Engine, or IBM Cloud Virtual Server.
					</p>
					<p>
						<br />When that server has the perfect amount of connections that you guessed it would have, great! This is, however,
						extremely unlikely... A good swell of business overwhelms your poor little server one day and he crashes, losing a lot of
						potential customers! You will anticipate this growing traffic next time, we're ready now! You provision larger and larger
						machines to handle these tasks, so upgrading your server's capacity - and cost.
					</p>
					<p>
						When server traffic does not grow as expected, you pay for the anticipated space and that server capacity is wasted as the
						machine sits idle. When you decide to downgrade a few months later after paying for wasted capacity, you get hit with a spike
						of traffic again (yay!) but are unable to handle it...yet again (on no!) causing downtime and loss of both users and revenue.
					</p>
					<p><br />How can we get around this seemingly impossible task of perfectly provisioning the correct server size?</p>
					<p><br />You guessed it! Go Serverless!</p>
					<p>
						<br />Switching from this traditional architecture to a serverless one allows you to forget about provisioning resources,
						letting the service provider deal with all "under the hood" logic required when scaling, so that you always pay
						<b>only</b> for the resources that you actually use.
					</p>
					<p>
						Under a serverless model, you get to simply develop the APIs that your application needs, and deploy them independantly of the
						system or each other, and your chosen service provider will handle the rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						You no longer need to constantly pay for unused server capacity, and will never again be underprepared for the day your app
						hits the front page on the app store and gains immense traffic. As your user flow increases AWS, Google, or IBM will scale
						your functions accordingly with predicable price points per request.
					</p>
					<p>
						<br /><br />Luddites beware, my next post will dive into the underlying tech which allow these services to perform to scale.
						It might go over your head, but is defintiely interesting and well worth the read...
