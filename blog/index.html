					<h2>Why go Serverless?</h2>

					<h5>
						Serverless architectures seem to be all the rage in the Cloud Computing world today, heres a brief discussion on why, and what
						they might offer you and your business.
					</h5>

					<img class="image" src="./images/drawing-38.jpg" />
					<p>
						<br />AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions square up against traditional server architectures in
						a battle to the death. (Just kidding, servers are still useful in some solutions)
					</p>

					<p>
						<br />Traditional application server architectures contain a central server that loiter around listening for incoming
						requests, processing them whenever they come in, and burning your money while they aren't. This server can be an on-premises
						or a remote hosted one, such as AWS EC2 instance, Google Compute Engine, or IBM Cloud Virtual Server.
					</p>
					<p>
						<br />When that server has the perfect amount of connections that you guessed it would have, great! This is, however,
						extremely unlikely... A good swell of business overwhelms your poor little server one day and he crashes, losing a lot of
						potential customers! You will anticipate this growing traffic next time, we're ready now! You provision larger and larger
						machines to handle these tasks, so upgrading your server's capacity - and cost.
					</p>
					<p>
						When server traffic does not grow as expected, you pay for the anticipated space and that server capacity is wasted as the
						machine sits idle. When you decide to downgrade a few months later after paying for wasted capacity, you get hit with a spike
						of traffic again (yay!) but are unable to handle it...yet again (on no!) causing downtime and loss of both users and revenue.
					</p>
					<p><br />How can we get around this seemingly impossible task of perfectly provisioning the correct server size?</p>
					<p><br />You guessed it! Go Serverless!</p>
					<p>
						<br />Switching from this traditional architecture to a serverless one allows you to forget about provisioning resources,
						letting the service provider deal with all "under the hood" logic required when scaling, so that you always pay
						<b>only</b> for the resources that you actually use.
					</p>
					<p>
						Under a serverless model, you get to simply develop the APIs that your application needs, and deploy them independantly of the
						system or each other, and your chosen service provider will handle the rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						You no longer need to constantly pay for unused server capacity, and will never again be underprepared for the day your app
						hits the front page on the app store and gains immense traffic. As your user flow increases AWS, Google, or IBM will scale
						your functions accordingly with predicable price points per request.
					</p>
					<p>
						<br /><br />Luddites beware, my next post will dive into the underlying tech which allow these services to perform to scale.
						It might go over your head, but is defintiely interesting and well worth the read...
