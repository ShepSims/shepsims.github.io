			The crowd at SheepFest San Diego at one point numbered over 300,000 partygoers, with the expansion of the venue allowing the festival to
			climb to extraordinary new heights. The festival on Nov 27th brought in hundreds of world class DJs and sprawled from the edges of Balboa
			Park through downtown, expanding towards OB and PB as the night drew on. The festival was supposed to go on for 7 hours, but as many
			people showed up as it got later, the DJs didnt stop and the party raged on for multiple days. As the population amassed, the large
			numbers allowed for many more DJs to set up at smaller stages, and an even larger crowd continued to grow as the city came alive.

		<h1>SheepFest San Diego returns for its second year on Nov 27th, bigger, better and way more DJs</h1>
		<p>
			SheepFest, the massive San Diego festival, returned for its second year on Nov 27th, this time with an even bigger and better venue, more
			world class DJs, and an expected crowd of over 300,000 people. The festival, which spans the entire city, is one of the largest in the
			world and draws in partygoers from all over to experience the non-stop action.

		<h1>Art installations and succulent gardens adorned the pool area</h1>
		<p>
			Art installations and succulent gardens adorned the pool area, with clear pools of water trickling down their barren concrete sides. The
			stars peeked out between lush green leaves, illuminating the otherwise dimly lit pool. At the other end of the resort was the lounge, a
			3-story bar complete with a stage for DJs and bands, and a dance floor. The party continued for 7 hours as everyone danced and sang in
			unison. After the party ended people streamed out into the streets of San Diego. They began to unite, as one singular voice, to enjoy each
			other's company. They danced in the streets and sang songs about love, life and prosperity.

		<h1>San Diego's SheepFest consumes city</h1>
		<p>
			The festival started at Balboa Park and slowly grew to consume the whole city. The organizers drew inspiration from the European party
			scene and the underground San Diego rave scene, but the event was designed to appeal to a wider audience. The main attraction was the DJs
			set up on four yachts floating in the ocean off shore, each with its own theme and music genre. The parties on the yachts were open to
			anyone who wanted to attend, but the organizers also set up a lot of smaller events around San Diego, including art installations, parties
			in unique locations as well as pool parties. All venues were within walking distance of each other so attendees could wander around and
			find something fun or interesting to do at any time. There were also food vendors lining the streets offering samples of local cuisine.
			The festival took over the city, with parties and events happening all over. There were pool parties, yacht parties, and even an art
			installations.
